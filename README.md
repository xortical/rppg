# **Remote PPG (Photoplethysmography)**

Learn how to use Computer Vision to obtain an rPPG. 

## **(Brief) Background**
A [Photoplethysmography](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Photoplethysmography-(PPG).aspx) (PPG) is an optical technique that can detect volumetric changes in blood that correspond to the heart beat. PPGs are typically obtained by a contact optical sensor, but if sufficient lighting conditions are rpesent, we can use a Camera as our sensor and then use Computer Vision techniques to extract the PPG signal remotely.
